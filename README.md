# Task 1: software configuration

## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I'm always up to new challenges and constant learning. 
My journey in IT started with technical support role, and then I slowly transitioned in software development (frontend). Since automation QA would require both coding and soft skills 
I thought Dare IT challenge is something I want to try myself in.
I trust this challenge will bring me lots of knowledge and new acquaintances.
